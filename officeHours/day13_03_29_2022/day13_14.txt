        - Method Overloading
        - Wrapper Class Intro

            - parseInt(),parseDouble() etc vs valueOf()
            - Auto-Boxing vs Unboxing


      ===  Create a package named "day_Date" under the folder "officeHours"  ===



          = OverLoading =

      Task 1 :   Create a method called calcFeetAndInchesToCentimeters . It needs to have two parameters.
			   Feet is the first parameter, inches is the second parameter.

				- You should validate that the first parameter feet is >=0, and second parameter inches is >=0 and <=12.
					 Return -1 from the method if either of the above is not true.

				- If the parameters are valid, then calculate how many centimeters comprise the feet and inches passed to this
				 		  method and return that value.

				- Create a second method of the same name but with only one parameter inches is the parameter and validate it
						  >=0, return -1 if it is not true. But if it is valid, then calculate how many feet are in the inches.

				- Call the other overloaded method passing the correct feet and inches calculated so that it can calculate
								correctly.

				- Hints : Use double for your number datatypes 1 inch = 2.54cm and 1 ft =12 inches

        Task 2 : Fibonacci

				Create a method that will give you the Fibonacci numbers up to the x value. Where x is the given parameter.
				Fibonacci is a sequence of number starting from 0, 1 where the following numbers are the sum of the previous 2 numbers

				Note: Fibonacci numbers are read as index values, so the 0th Fibonacci is 0, 1st value is 1, 2nd value is 1, etc

				    Ex:
				        Input:
				            8
				        Output:
				            0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21


         Task 3:  Write a method that,
                       given an integer N (1 < N < 100), returns an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0.
                        The method can return any such array.
                        For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1,0, -3,2] or [-2,1, -4,5].
                        The answer [1, -1,1,3] would be incorrect (because value 1 occurs twice).
                        For N = 3 one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1] (but there are many more correct answers).


        = Wrapper Practice =

        Task 4 : Please implement this method to return the sum of all integers found in the parameter String.

                    String s="jav45ai1000sgre1at82"
                     result: 45+1000+1+82 ----> 1128

        Task 5: Write a method that can verify if a password is a strong password. Characteristics of strong passwords are:
                       1.1 Password must be at least have 8 characters long, and should not contain space
                       1.2 PassWord should at least contain one upper case letter
                       1.3 PassWord should at least contain one lower case letter
                       1.4 Password should at least contain one special characters
                       1.5 Password should at least contain a digit
