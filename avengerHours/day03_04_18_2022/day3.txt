Day 3 --> 04.18.2022


        Topics : - Data Types Vs Variable Types
                 - Classes and Objects
                 - Task 01 (class, objects, instance/static variables, constructors, static block, arrayList, etc. )


Task 01 :

   -Create a class named Book,
        -5 Instance variables : String name, category, author, bookID;
                              int shelfNum(assign it with respect to categories )  ;

        -1 Static variable :    int bookCount; (initiate it in a static block)

        -3 constructors : name /// name + category /// name + category + author  (implement constructor chaining)

        -2 methods : 1- toString()
                     2- IDgenerator() -> assign shelfNum and assign bookID with that format; ShelfNum_AuthorNameInitial_BookNameFirst2letters
                     (eg: adventure book =>  Moby Dick / Herman Melville; bookID= 1_H_Mo)

                                        Categories:  - Adventure (shelfNum = 1)
                                                     - Classics (shelfNum = 2)
                                                     - Comics (shelfNum = 3)
                                                     - Fantasy (shelfNum = 4)
                                                     - History (shelfNum = 5)
                                                     - Otherwise (shelfNum = 0)
   =======================================================================================

   -Create a class named Library
        -create Book objects
        -find the number off all books in the library with the help of "static" feature
        -create allBooks arrayList
        -create fantasyBooks arraylist by using allBooks collection
